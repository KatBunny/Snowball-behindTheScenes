The backend server to my Snowball Goal tracker API

#### Katherine Sinkler
* Hello, I am creating a goal setting api that is meant to track goals that have many parts and keep progress of the parts as they are accomplished so that the user can realize that doing one thing at a time can really add up when careful planning and tracking is considered.  This project will include a sign in page that should link into a page where goals and goal steps are listed. There will be a cache of data within a user's account and a way to track progress according to a time frame set. I have a stretch goal to include some kind of animation of a snowman being built as the goal progresses with a complete build of a snowman at the completion of each goal. 
I would also like to allow the user to set reminder notificaions according to their comfort level.
